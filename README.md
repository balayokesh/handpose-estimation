# Team : Indhackers

# Project Name : AI Recognition System for Hand Pose Estimation and Gesture Recognition 🤩🔥

## This project is made for the Hackathon 🤩 as well as for the sake of benefit to humanity😊

# Hack/idea : 
The required hack/idea we built is a customized solution which can be used for society and consists of a AI based Recognition System which can do Handpose Estimation(using Handpose model of Tensorflow.js) and also Gesture Recognition(using Fingerpose model of Tensorflow.js) using Tensorflow.Js and React.Js to help that person interact with the fellows easily through easy hand movements

## You can even fork it to have it in ur own Github
# If you want to experience how the code is written , You can even Clone / Download it to analyse it in ur own machine 🔥🔥

## Dont forget to give it ur love 💝 and necessarily a Star ✨=======
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
